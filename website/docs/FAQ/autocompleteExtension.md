# Does tailwind-3dtransforms-plugin support autocomplete?

Yes.

To get the autocomplete support you can install the official tailwindcss extension for VSCode and other supported IDEs.

You can find supported IDEs [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup).

After you install the extension/plugin, make sure you also have installed this plugin and added to plugin list of `tailwind.config.js` file. [You can find the complete installation tutorial on quick-start](/).

Once you added our plugin to the `tailwind.config.js`, autocomplete should be available for all classes.

If you find any issues, you can raise an issue on the [tailwind-3dtransforms-plugin](https://github.com/XPD-Kasun/tailwind-3dtransform-plugin/issues) repository.
